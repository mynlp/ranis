### NOTE

28 instances of the <a class="relation" nolink>split</a> relation were encountered in the annotation effort. We propose that as the phenomena captured by this relation can also be annotated using discontinuous span annotations, this relation type can be eliminated in a future revision and do not define it for the time being.
