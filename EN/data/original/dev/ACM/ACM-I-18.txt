Collaboration Among a Satellite Swarm
The paper deals with on-board planning for a satellite swarm via communication and negotiation.
We aim at defining individual behaviours that result in a global behaviour that meets the mission requirements.
We will present the formalization of the problem, a communication protocol, a solving method based on reactive decision rules, and first results.
