Substring-Based Transliteration .
Transliteration is the task of converting a word from one alphabetic script to another .
We present a novel , substring-based approach to transliteration , inspired by phrasebased models of machine translation .
We investigate two implementations of substring-based transliteration : a dynamic programming algorithm , and a finite-state transducer .
We show that our substring-based transducer not only outperforms a state-of-the-art letter-based approach by a significant margin , but is also orders of magnitude faster .
