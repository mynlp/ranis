A Class-Based Probabilistic Approach To Structural Disambiguation .
Knowledge of which words are able to fill particular argument slots of a predicate can be used tbr structural disambiguation .
This paper describes a proposal for acquiring such knowledge , and in line with much of the recent work in this area , a probabilistic approach is taken .
We develop a novel way of using a semantic hierarchy to estimate the probabilities , and demonstrate the general approach using a prepositional phrase attachment experiment .
