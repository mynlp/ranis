We have analyzed 607 sentences of spontaneous human-computer speech data containing repairs ( drawn from a corpus of 10,718 ) .
We present here criteria and techniques for automatically detecting the presence of a repair , its location , and making the appropriate correction.
The criteria involve integration of knowledge from several sources : pattern matching , syntactic and semantic analysis , and acoustics .
