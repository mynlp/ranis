Generating Full Paraphrases of Fragments in a Dialogue Interpretation System

Using SHARDS -- a semantically-based HPSG approach to the resolution of dialogue fragments -- we will show how to generate full paraphrases for fragments in dialogue.
We adopt a template-filler approach that does not require deep generation from an underlying semantic representation.
Instead it reuses the results of the parse and interpretation process to dynamically compute templates and to update fillers as the dialogue proceeds.
This recycling of already available syntactic and phonological information makes generation efficient, as it reduces the operations of the generator to mere string manipulations.
