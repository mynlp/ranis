Machine Translation As Lexicalized Parsing With Hooks .
We adapt the `` hook '' trick for speeding up bilexical parsing to the decoding problem for machine translation models that are based on combining a synchronous context free grammar as the translation model with an n-gram language model .
This dynamic programming technique yields lower complexity algorithms than have previously been described for an important class of translation models .
