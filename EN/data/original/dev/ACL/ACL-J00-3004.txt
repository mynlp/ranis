A Compression-Based Algorithm For Chinese Word Segmentation .
Chinese is written without using spaces or other word delimiters .
Although a text may be thought of as a corresponding sequence of words , there is considerable ambiguity in the placement of boundaries .
Interpreting a text as a sequence of words is beneficial for some information retrieval and storage tasks : for example , full-text search , word-based compression , and keyphrase extraction .
We describe a scheme that infers appropriate positions for word boundaries using an adaptive language model that is standard in text compression .
It is trained on a corpus of presegmented text , and when applied to new text , interpolates word boundaries so as to maximize the compression obtained .
This simple and general method performs well with respect to specialized schemes for Chinese language segmentation .
