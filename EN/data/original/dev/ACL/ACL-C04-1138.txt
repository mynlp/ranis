Multilingual and cross-lingual news topic tracking

We are presenting a working system for automated news analysis that ingests an average total of 7600 news articles per day in five languages.
For each language, the system detects the major news stories of the day using a group-average unsupervised agglomerative clustering process.
It also tracks, for each cluster, related groups of articles published over the previous seven days, using a cosine of weighted terms. The system furthermore tracks related news across languages, in all language pairs involved.
The cross-lingual news cluster similarity is based on a linear combination of three types of input: (a) cognates, (b) automatically detected references to geographical place names and (c) the results of a mapping process onto a multilingual classification system.
A manual evaluation showed that the system produces good results.
