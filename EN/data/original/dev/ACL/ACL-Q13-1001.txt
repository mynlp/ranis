Token and Type Constraints for Cross-Lingual Part-of-Speech Tagging

We consider the construction of part-of-speech taggers for resource-poor languages.
Recently, manually constructed tag dictionaries from Wiktionary and dictionaries projected via bitext have been used as type constraints to overcome the scarcity of annotated data in this setting.
In this paper, we show that additional token constraints can be projected from a resource-rich source language to a resource-poor target
language via word-aligned bitext.
We present several models to this end; in particular a partially observed conditional random field model, where coupled token and type constraints provide a partial signal for training.
Averaged across eight previously studied Indo-European languages, our model achieves a 25% relative error reduction over the prior state of the art.
We further present successful results on seven additional languages from different families, empirically demonstrating the applicability
of coupled token and type constraints across a diverse set of languages.
