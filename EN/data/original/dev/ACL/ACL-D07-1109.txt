A Topic Model for Word Sense Disambiguation

We develop latent Dirichlet alocation with WORDNET (LDAWN), an unsupervised probabilistic topic model that includes word sense as a hidden variable.
We develop a probabilistic posterior inference algorithm for simultaneously disambiguating a corpus and learning the domains in which to consider each word.
Using the WORDNET hierarchy, we embed the construction of Abney and Light (1999) in the topic model and show that automatically learned domainsimprove WSD accuracy compared to alternative contexts.
