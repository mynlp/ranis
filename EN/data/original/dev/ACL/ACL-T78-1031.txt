Path-Based And Node-Based Inference In Semantic Networks .
Two styles of performing inference in semantic networks are presented and compared .
Path-based inference allows an arc or a path of arcs between two given nodes to be inferred from the existence of another specified path between the same two nodes .
Path-based inference rules may be written using a binary relational calculus notation .
Node-based inference allows a structure of nodes to be inferred from the existence of an instance of a pattern of node structures .
Node-based inference rules can be constructed in a semantic network using a variant of a predicate calculus notation .
Path-based inference is more efficient , while node-based inference is more general .
A method is described of combining the two styles in a single system in order to take advantage of the strengths of each .
Applications of path-based inference rules to the representation of the extensional equivalence of intensional concepts , and to the explication of inheritance in hierarchies are sketched .
