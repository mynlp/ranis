A methodology for obtaining concept graphs from word graphs

In this work, we describe a methodology based on the Stochastic Finite State Transducers paradigm for Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) for obtaining concept graphs from word graphs.
In the edges of these concept graphs, both semantic and lexical information are represented.
This makes these graphs a very useful representation of the information for SLU.
The best path in these concept graphs provides the best sequence of concepts.
