Tools And Methods For Computational Lexicology .
This paper presents a set of tools and methods for acquiring , manipulating , and analyzing machinereadable dictionaries .
We give several detailed examples of the use of these tools and methods for particular analyses .
A novel aspect of our work is that it allows the combined processing of multiple machine-readable dictionaries .
Our examples describe analyses of data from Webster 's Seventh Collegiate Dictionary , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English , the Collins bilingual dictionaries , the Collins Thesaurus , and the Zingarelli Italian dictionary .
We describe existing facilities and results they have produced as well as planned enhancements to those facilities , particularly in the area of managing associations involving the senses of polysemous words .
We show how these enhancements expand the ways in which we can exploit machine-readable dictionaries in the construction of large lexicons for natural language processing systems .
