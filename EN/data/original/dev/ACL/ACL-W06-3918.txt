The Alligator theorem prover for dependent type systems : Description and proof samples .
This paper introduces the Alligator theorem prover for Dependent Type Systems ( DTS ) .
We start with highlighting a number of properties of DTS that make them specifically suited for computational semantics .
We then briefly introduce DTS and our implementation .
The paper concludes with an example of a DTS proof that illustrates the suitability of DTS for modelling anaphora resolution .
