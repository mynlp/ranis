Automatic Detection of Point of View Differences in Wikipedia

We investigate differences in point of view (POV) between two objective documents, where one is describing the subject matter in a more positive/negative way than the other, and present an automatic method for detecting such POV differences.
We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to annotate sentences as positive, negative or neutral based on their POV towards a given target.
A statistical classifier is trained to predict the POV score of a document, which reflects how positive/negative the document's POV towards its target is.
The results of our experiments on a set of articles in the Arabic and English Wikipedias from the people category show that our method successfully detects POV differences.
