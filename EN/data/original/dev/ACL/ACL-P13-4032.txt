VSEM: An open library for visual semantics representation

VSEM is an open library for visual se-mantics.
Starting from a collection of tagged images,  it is possible to automatically construct an image-based representation of concepts by using off-the-shelf VSEM functionalities.
VSEM is entirely written in MATLAB and its object-oriented design allows a large flexibility and reusability.
The software is accompanied by a website with supporting documentation and examples.
