An Double Hidden HMM and an CRF for Segmentation Tasks with Pinyin's Finals

We have participated in the open tracks and closed tracks on four corpora of Chinese word segmentation tasks in CIPS-SIGHAN-2010 Bake-offs.
In our experiments, we used the Chinese inner phonology information in all tracks.
For open tracks, we proposed a double hidden layers' HMM (DHHMM) in which Chinese inner phonology information was used as one hidden layer and the BIO tags as another hidden layer.
N-best results were firstly generated by using DHHMM, then the best one was selected by using a new lexical statistic measure.
For close tracks, we used CRF model in which the Chinese inner phonology information was used as features.
