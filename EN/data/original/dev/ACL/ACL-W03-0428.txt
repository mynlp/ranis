Named Entity Recognition With Character-Level Models .
We discuss two named-entity recognition models which use characters and character n-grams either exclusively or as an important part of their data representation .
The first model is a character-level HMM with minimal context information , and the second model is a maximum-entropy conditional markov model with substantially richer context features .
Our best model achieves an overall F1 of 86.07 % on the English test data ( 92.31 % on the development data ) .
This number represents a 25 % error reduction over the same model without word-internal ( substring ) features .
