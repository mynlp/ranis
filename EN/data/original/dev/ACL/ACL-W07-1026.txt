Automatic Indexing of Specialized Documents : Using Generic vs. Domain-Specific Document Representations .
The shift from paper to electronic documents has caused the curation of information sources in large electronic databases to become more generalized .
In the biomedical domain , continuing efforts aim at refining indexing tools to assist with the update and maintenance of databases such as MEDLINE (R) .
In this paper , we evaluate two statistical methods of producing MeSH (R) indexing recommendations for the genetics literature , including recommendations involving subheadings , which is a novel application for the methods .
We show that a generic representation of the documents yields both better precision and recall .
We also find that a domain-specific representation of the documents can contribute to enhancing recall .
