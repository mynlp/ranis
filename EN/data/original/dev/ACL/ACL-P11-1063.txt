Incremental Syntactic Language Models for Phrase-based Translation

This paper describes a novel technique for incorporating syntactic knowledge into phrase-based machine translation through incremental syntactic parsing. Bottom-up and top-down parsers typically require a completed string as input.
This requirement makes it difficult to incorporate them into phrase-based translation, which generates partial hypothesized translations from left-to-right.
Incremental syntactic language models score sentences in a similar left-to-right fashion, and are therefore a good mechanism for incorporating syntax into phrase-based translation.
We give a formal definition of one such linear-time syntactic language model, detail its relation to phrase-based decoding, and integrate the model with the Moses phrase-based translation system.
We present empirical results on a constrained Urdu-English translation task that demonstrate a significant BLEU score improvement and a large decrease in perplexity.
