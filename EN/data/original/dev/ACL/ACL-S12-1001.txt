Casting Implicit Role Linking as an Anaphora Resolution Task

Linking implicit semantic roles is a challenging problem in discourse processing.
Unlike prior work inspired by SRL, we cast this problem as an anaphora resolution task and embed it in an entity-based coreference resolution (CR) architecture.
Our experiments clearly show that CR-oriented features yield strongest performance exceeding a strong baseline.
We address the problem of data sparsity by applying heuristic labeling techniques, guided by the anaphoric nature of the phenomenon.
We achieve performance beyond state-of-the art.
