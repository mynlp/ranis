Corpus-Based Syntactic Error Detection Using Syntactic Patterns .
This paper presents a parsing system for the detection of syntactic errors .
It combines a robust partial parser which obtains the main sentence components and a finite-state parser used for the description of syntactic error patterns .
The system has been tested on a corpus of real texts , containing both correct and incorrect sentences , with promising results .
