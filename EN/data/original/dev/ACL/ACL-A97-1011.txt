A Non-Projective Dependency Parser .
We describe a practical parser for unrestricted dependencies .
The parser creates links between words and names the links according to their syntactic functions .
We first describe the older Constraint Grammar parser where many of the ideas come from .
Then we proceed to describe the central ideas of our new parser .
Finally , the parser is evaluated .
