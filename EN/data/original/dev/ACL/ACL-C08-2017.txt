Modelling Multilinguality in Ontologies

Multilinguality in ontologies has become an impending need for institutions worldwide with valuable linguistic resources in different natural languages.
Since most ontologies are developed in one language, obtaining multilingual ontologies implies to localize or adapt them to a concrete language and culture com munity.
As the adaptation of the ontology conceptualization demands considerable efforts, we propose to modify the ontology terminological layer, and provide a model called Linguistic Information Repository (LIR) that associated to the ontology meta-model allows terminological layer localization.
