Semantic Role Labeling of Implicit Arguments for Nominal Predicates

Nominal predicates often carry implicit arguments. Recent work on semantic role labeling has focused on identifying arguments within the local context of a predicate; implicit arguments, however, have not been systematically examined.
To address this limitation, we have manually annotated a corpus of implicit arguments for ten predicates from NomBank.
Through analysis of this corpus, we find that implicit arguments add 71% to the argument structures that are present in NomBank.
Using the corpus, we train a discriminative model that is able to identify implicit arguments with an F1 score of 50%, significantly outperforming an informed baseline model.
This article describes our investigation, explores a wide variety of features important for the task, and discusses future directions for work on implicit argument identification.
