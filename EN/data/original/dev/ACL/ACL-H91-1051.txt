Context Dependent Modeling Of Phones In Continuous Speech Using Decision Trees .
In a continuous speech recognition system it is important to model the context dependent variations in the pronunciations of words .
In this paper we present an automatic method for modeling phonological variation using decision trees .
For each phone we construct a decision tree that specifies the acoustic realization of the phone as a function of the context in which it appears .
Several thousand sentences from a natural language corpus spoken by several talkers are used to construct these decision trees .
Experimental results on a 5000-word vocabulary natural language speech recognition task are presented .
