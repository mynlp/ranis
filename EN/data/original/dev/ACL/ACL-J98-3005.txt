Generating Natural Language Summaries From Multiple On-Line Sources .
We present a methodology for summarization of news about current events in the form of briefings that include appropriate background ( historical ) information .
The system that we developed , SUMMONS , uses the output of systems developed for the DARPA Message Understanding Conferences to generate summaries of multiple documents on the same or related events , presenting similarities and differences , contradictions , and generalizations among sources of information .
We describe the various components of the system , showing how information from multiple articles is combined , organized into a paragraph , and finally , realized as English sentences .
A feature of our work is the extraction of descriptions of entities such as people and places for reuse to enhance a briefing .
