Discriminative Word Alignment via Alignment Matrix Modeling .
In this paper a new discriminative word alignment method is presented .
This approach models directly the alignment matrix by a conditional random field ( CRF ) and so no restrictions to the alignments have to be made .
Furthermore , it is easy to add features and so all available information can be used .
Since the structure of the CRFs can get complex , the inference can only be done approximately and the standard algorithms had to be adapted .
In addition , different methods to train the model have been developed .
Using this approach the alignment quality could be improved by up to 23 percent for 3 different language pairs compared to a combination of both IBM4-alignments .
Furthermore the word alignment was used to generate new phrase tables .
These could improve the translation quality significantly .
