Transforming Examples Into Patterns For Information Extraction .
Information Extraction ( IE ) systems today are commonly based on pattern matching .
The patterns are regular expressions stored in a customizable knowledge base .
Adapting an IE system to a new subject domain entails the construction of a new pattern base - a time-consuming and expensive task .
We describe a strategy for building patterns from examples .
To adapt the IE system to a new domain quickly , the user chooses a set of examples in a training text , and for each example gives the logical form entries which the example induces .
The system transforms these examples into patterns and then applies meta-rules to generalize these patterns .
