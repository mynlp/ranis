Paraphrasing with Search Engine Query Logs

This paper proposes a method that extracts paraphrases from search engine query logs.
The method first extracts paraphrase query-title pairs based on an assumption that a search query and its corresponding clicked document titles may mean the same thing.
It then extracts paraphrase query-query and title-title pairs from the query-title paraphrases with a pivot approach.
Paraphrases extracted in each step are validated with a binary classifier.
We evaluate the method using a query log from Baidu1, a Chinese search engine.
Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective, which extracts more than 3.5 million pairs of paraphrases with a precision of over 70%.
The results also show that the extracted paraphrases can be used to generate high-quality paraphrase patterns.
