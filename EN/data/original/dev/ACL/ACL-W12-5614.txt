CUNI: Feature Selection and Error Analysis of a Transition-Based Parser

We describe the parsing system used at the Charles University (CUNI) for the Hindi Parsing Shared Task 2012.
We used the publicly available Malt Parser, which is highly configurable.
A substantial part of the paper describes the configuration that we selected.
The parser performs reasonably well in identifying the head nodes.
The main weakness is in labeling the dependency relations.
We identify the most prominent error types, which should help to improve the parsing accuracy in future.
