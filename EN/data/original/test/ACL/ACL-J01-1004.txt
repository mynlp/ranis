D-Tree Substitution Grammars

There is considerable interest among computational linguists in lexicalized grammatical frameworks; lexicalized tree adjoining grammar (LTAG) is one widely studied example.
In this paper, we investigate how derivations in LTAG can be viewed not as manipulations of trees but as manipulations of tree descriptions.
Changing the way the lexicalized formalism is viewed raises questions as to the desirability of certain aspects of the formalism.
We present a new formalism, d-tree substitution grammar (DSG).
Derivations in DSG involve the composition of d-trees, special kinds of tree descriptions.
Trees are read off from derived d-trees.
We show how the DSG formalism, which is designed to inherit many of the characterestics of LTAG, can be used to express a variety of linguistic analyses not available in LTAG.
